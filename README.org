** Overview
This repository contains Python scripts to download, process, and aggregate
electricity price and demand data from the Australian Energy Market Operator
(AEMO). The scripts store the processed data in an SQLite database and provide
aggregated hourly statistics.

** Features
In Python:
- Downloads price and demand data from AEMO using `wget`
- Stores data in an SQLite database (`model.db`)
- Aggregates data into hourly bins
- Calculates:
  - Average, minimum, and maximum values for demand and RRP (Regional Reference Price)
  - Sum and sum of squares for demand and RRP (for variance calculation)
  - Count of records per hour

** Installation
*** Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python3 installed along with the required dependencies. You can install them using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

It might also be worthwhile using a virtual environment, prior to installing
additional requirements, by using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python -m venv venv
  . venv/bin/activate
#+END_SRC

*** Configuration
The database configuration is stored in `config.yaml`:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
database:
  path: model.db
#+END_SRC

Modify this file if you wish to change the database path.

This configuration files also contains details of the year and dlownload
location for the downloaded AEMO CSV files.

** Usage
*** Step 1: Download Data
Run the script to download CSV files from AEMO:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python download_data.py
#+END_SRC

*** Step 2: Import Data into SQLite
After downloading, import the data into the SQLite database:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python import_data.py
#+END_SRC

*** Step 3: Aggregate Data
Run the aggregation script to calculate hourly statistics:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python hourly_aggregation_query.py
#+END_SRC

** Output
The aggregated data is stored in the `price_and_demand_aggregation` table in `model.db`. The table schema includes:

- `REGION` (Text)
- `HOUR` (Timestamp, rounded to the hour)
- `COUNT` (Number of records aggregated per hour)
- `AVG_DEMAND`, `MIN_DEMAND`, `MAX_DEMAND` (Demand statistics)
- `AVG_RRP`, `MIN_RRP`, `MAX_RRP` (RRP statistics)
- `SUM_RRP`, `SUM_RRP_SQUARED` (For variance calculation)
- `SUM_DEMAND`, `SUM_DEMAND_SQUARED` (For variance calculation)
